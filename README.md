# Usage


| HC-SR04 | ESP32   |
|---------|---------|
| VCC     | VIN     |
| Trig    | GPIO 5  |
| Echo    | GPIO 18 |
| GND     | GND     |

First, you need to import the HCSR04 class from the hcsr04 library. Additionally, you also need to import the time library to add delays to our code.
```python
from hcsr04 import HCSR04
from time import sleep
```
Then, create an HCSR04 object called sensor that refers to the HCSR04 sensor. Pass as arguments the trigger pin, the echo pin, and the timeout (maximum travel time of the sound wave, when the sensor is probably out of range).
```python
sensor = HCSR04(trigger_pin=5, echo_pin=18, echo_timeout_us=10000)
```
To get the distance in cm, you just need to call the distance_cm method on the sensor object. Save the result in the distance variable.
```python
distance = sensor.distance_cm()
```
The library also provides a method to get the distance in millimeters without floating point. You just need to call.
```python
distance = sensor.distance_mm()
```
Print the distance on the Micropython shell.
```python
print("Distance:", distance, "cm")
```
In the end, you need to add a delay of one second (the distance is updated every second).
```python
sleep(1)
```

| DHT22 | ESP32 |
|-------|-------|
| VCC   | 3.3 V |
| GPIO  | 14    |
| GND   | GND   |

Before requesting temperature and humidity, you need to use the measure() method on the sensor object.
```python
sensor.measure()
```
Then, read the temperature with sensor.temperature() and the humidity with sensor.humidity(). Save those readings on the temp and hum variables.
```python
temp = sensor.temperature()
```
The following command converts the temperature to Fahrenheit degrees.
```python
temp_f = temp * (9/5) + 32.0
```
Finally, print all the readings on the MicroPython shell using the print() function.
```python
print("Temperature: %3.1f C" %temp)
print("Temperature: %3.1f F" %temp_f)
print("Humidity: %3.1f %%" %hum)
```
